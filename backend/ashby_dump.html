  <meta name="description" content="At Linear, we are on a mission to bring magic back to software. To empower product teams to do their best work, we are building an issue tracking and project management tool that combines UI elegance with world-class performance. Founded in 2019, Linear has become the platform of choice for 20,000+ companies to plan and build their products.

Linear was set up as a fully remote company from the start. Today, our small but mighty team is distributed across North America and Europe. What unites us is relentless focus, fast execution, and our passion for software craftsmanship. We are all makers at heart and care deeply about the quality of our work.

Over the past few years, Linear has experienced incredible organic growth globally and has become the default tool of choice for many of the world’s best product teams. We are now expanding into APAC and hiring our first sales rep in the region to accelerate growth with some of the world’s most innovative product and engineering teams. You will be the tip of the spear for Linear in APAC—building pipeline from a strong PLG foundation, shaping the regional go-to-market, and helping us learn how to serve APAC customers at scale. This is a rare opportunity to build a new market with a category-defining product and a globally recognized brand.

Please note: We are an equal opportunity employer and remote-only company. At this time, we can support hiring within the eastern Australian time zone (AEST).

What you’ll do

 - Develop deep product expertise and help prospects evaluate and adopt Linear

 - Build and own the APAC pipeline end-to-end; consistently exceed quarterly targets

 - Partner closely across time zones with Sales, CS, Product, and Engineering to surface customer insights and shape product priorities

 - Serve as the voice of the APAC customer internally, identifying blockers to adoption or scale

 - Help build the foundation of Linear’s sales motion in APAC—playbooks, processes, tooling, regional feedback loops

 - Represent Linear in the region as an ambassador of our craft-driven, customer-obsessed culture

What we’re looking for

 - 4+ years in a quota-carrying SaaS sales role

 - Experience selling to technical audiences (engineering, product, IT); extra credit for developer tools or collaboration platforms

 - Proven success driving net-new business in a new or emerging market

 - Comfort operating in a fast-moving startup environment; highly autonomous, resourceful, and proactive

 - Strong discovery skills and ability to articulate value and ROI to executive buyers

 - Excellent written and verbal communication and product demo skills

 - Ability to work across global time zones and collaborate asynchronously

 - Bilingual proficiency preferred; English and at least one major Asian language (e.g. Japanese, Korean)

What we offer

 - Interesting and challenging work with a high degree of ownership

 - Remote-first culture with flexibility around how and where you work

 - Competitive salary and equity with employee-friendly terms (early exercise, extended exercise)

 - 5 weeks of paid vacation

 - 4 months paid parental leave

 - Stipend to set up your home office + optional coworking space

 - Paid lunch and coffee during workdays

 - Regular team events and offsites

 - (Region-specific benefits can be added based on location)
